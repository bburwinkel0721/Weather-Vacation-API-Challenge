# Weather_Vacation_API_Challenge
## WeatherPy
- Created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Used the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
## VacationPy
- Used the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create map visualizations for the cities from weatherpy.
